# Knapsack-Problem
Project 1: Knapsack Problem Optimization

Objective: Develop an optimization model for packing shipments into a truck container, maximizing total value while respecting weight and volume constraints.
Process:
Formulated a mathematical model with decision variables and constraints.
Implemented logical constraints for shipment selection.
Problems Addressed:
Efficient packing of 500 shipments into a container with a weight capacity of 20,500 Kg and a volume capacity of 3,000 cu. ft.
Results:
Optimal Objective: $20,734.2
Top Twenty Shipments Selected: Shipment 205, 326, 137, 122, 221, 45, 426, 39, 450, 34, 352, 187, 466, 233, 293, 185, 474, 173, 178, 241.
